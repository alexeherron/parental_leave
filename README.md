Analysis of parental leave and gender wage gap around the globe

Beginning with the hypothesis that government-issued parental leave might have a correlation with lower gender wage gap, 
this project analyzes data from countries around the world using python, SQL, and Tableau.

[Data from OECD](https://stats.oecd.org/)

Conclusions: There appears to be no strong connection between government-issued parental leave and a lower gender wage gap. 
But Belgium has an exceptionally low wage gap (under 6%) in all three measured deciles (1st decile, 10th decile, and median). They issue 15 weeks of parental leave.
